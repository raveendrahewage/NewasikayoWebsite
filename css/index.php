Hostel life made us better person and a better human being
Life with no complaints but full compromises .
No expectations from anyone .
Understand the value of money.
Friends are like family
Creepy Roommates .
It brings two different kinds of people together in short time which lives forever.
It shows the reality of life.
Hostel life shows us how to choose friends and how to behave.
Understand the value of food.
Sharing is all about caring .
It's all about experiences
The only thing, that I miss in hostel that is foods thta our mothers give us.
There is no any regrets in hostel life.
Best days of our life
We really don't miss us because that memories are close to our hearts .</em></b></font></p></pre>
